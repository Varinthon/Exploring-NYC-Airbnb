# Project Title
Exploring New Tork City Aurbnb

# Project Description
Airbnb has revolutionized the travel industry since 2008 by providing a platform for homeowners and hosts to rent out their properties to guests seeking unique accommodation experiences, creating value through the sharing economy business model. According to Inside Airbnb, a site that scrapes Airbnb for listings data, New York City has become a big market for Airbnb, with more than 30,000 listings in the city. To explore the potential biases and factors that may influence pricing decisions on this large platform, our data project aims to analyze the New York City Airbnb dataset to identify various factors affecting Airbnb rentals and analyze the influence of independent variables. This can contribute to creating a sustainable lodging industry by providing important insights to stakeholders.
